# On the tranquility of mind #
The entire essay on the tranquility of mind is written as a conversation. 

### Serenus ###
We open on a note where Serenus describes his state of mind and he describes three kinds of problems, one of them being those which aren't visible but surface just at the right opportunity and don't allow the person to either fight it (since it's hidden most of the time) and neither to live peacefully. 

He then talks about how being accustomed to both wise and unwise men leads us to esteem them both alike. And how his mind, he feels is neither particularly inclined towards virtue neither vice. He talks of how while he is able to deny himself certain luxuries, he is lured by others. He imagines that **that way of life might be as good as his**. 

>  When I return from seeing it I am a sadder, though not a worse man, I cannot walk amid my own paltry possessions with so lofty a step as before, and silently there steals over me a feeling of vexation, and a doubt whether that way of life may not be better than mine. None of these things alter my principles, yet all of them disturb me

He mentions being at conflict in doing his duty, and how certain events cause him tiredness. How he tries to participate in life, but he finds himself losing his virtue and simplicity and instead going for fancy appearances, which he explains through an example of his writing. 

### Seneca ###

Seneca starts by assuring Serenus that what he needs in this condition of his is a confidence in his own ability to live virtuously. He says that his condition is like that of a person who has become healthy but is not accustomed to being healthy and therefore looks with anxiety at every symptom of the return of illness. 

Seneca provides some variations of the 'disease', by describing condition of mind of people who are not on the right path to virtue but chase other things. He talks about them at a great length, perhaps to assure Serenus that their way of life is not as good as his. 

He says how people like to flee from things, from their own state, and therefore they seek various activities, distractions and change of places. How some of them use these things to run away from their own mind and cannot endure themselves when alone. They squander their life, Seneca says, as they go from one shore to another, in an attempt to find refuge which they just can't get. And in the end, their lives end on a similar note.
